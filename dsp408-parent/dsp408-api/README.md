# dsp408-api

Public Java API for the DSP408/FIR408 controller.

## Bundle

- Maven artifact: `de.drremote:dsp408-api`
- OSGi symbolic name: `de.drremote.dsp408.api`
- Bundle name: `DSP408 API`
- Exported package: `de.drremote.dsp408.api`

## Purpose

This bundle contains the stable service contract used by the other bundles. It does not connect to the DSP by itself and does not contain protocol encoding logic. Runtime implementations, HTTP servlets, Karaf shell commands and the Matrix bot depend on this API.

## Main Types

- `DspService` - main control/query interface.
- `DspInstanceDto` - configured DSP instance summary for multi-DSP setups.
- `StateDto` - current connection, device and channel summary.
- `ChannelDto` - currently exposed per-channel state.
- `DeviceInfoDto` - device version and system info payload.
- `BlockDto` - cached or freshly read parameter block.
- `RawTxDto` - payload/frame hex returned by write operations.

## Covered Operations

`DspService` exposes the decoded DSP408 functions currently supported by the core:

- connection lifecycle and login
- device info, state, blocks and meters
- gain, mute, channel name, phase and delay
- preset load and preset-name read
- matrix routing and crosspoint gain
- crossover high-pass and low-pass
- output PEQ, input PEQ and input GEQ
- input gate, output compressor and output limiter
- test tone generator
- FIR408 processing mode, FIR generator and external FIR upload
- multi-DSP listing and per-DSP service selection
- shell, Matrix and volume-room command execution helpers

## Not In This Bundle

- No TCP socket handling.
- No DSP frame encoding/decoding.
- No OSGi component implementation.
- No HTTP, shell or Matrix transport.

Functions that are still `not_decoded` in the protocol libraries are intentionally not exposed as high-level methods.
